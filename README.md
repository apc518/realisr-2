# Realisr 2 🕰️
Ground-up reboot of Realisr as a client-side-only webapp with way more features

[Realisr 1](https://github.com/apc518/realisr.git) was written in Python and was not well optimized.

Realisr 2 is written in JavaScript and Rust, taking advantage of WebAssembly for increased performance.

## New Features (WIP)

- Live Editor: a simple click-and-drag editor that enables manual creation of timeplots
- Subdivisions: smooth out timeplots to create even weirder sounds
