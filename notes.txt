Timeplot representation: list of (point, vector)
    this stores 2x the data technically necessary but may make it easier to compute output

Iterate through vectors to gather important info:
    record max and min x values (to compute plot width)
    record how far along the path each vector is (this lets us know later where each segment comes from in the input audio)
    sum up total path length

Illustration:
    p5.js might work? probably not performant though
    D3? might be a good time to learn D3...

Old notes:
- Port realisr to Rust/WASM so it can be done efficiently, in the browser, client-side
- use svelte to wrap the UI
- add subdivision feature
    1. simple angle and length subdividing, like I experimented with on the original realisr
    2. iterative subdividing, preserving the measure transition points
    3. bezier curves
- add an editor where you can just draw the time plot and input some audio
