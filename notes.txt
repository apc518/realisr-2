the name "realisr" comes from:
    RLSR (randomized linked segmented rescale)
        This is why I use the british spelling; the acronym has an S not a Z.
    The theoretical backing of this project was projecting music from complex time into real time, so literally "making real" or "realizing".
    So, its a double entendre of sorts :)

Illustration:
    p5.js for a demo, but this is not performant so should be replaced eventually with...
    D3? svg based, might be a good time to learn D3...
    Cytoscape? canavas based, pretty well optimized it seems https://js.cytoscape.org



Old notes:
- Port realisr to Rust/WASM so it can be done efficiently, in the browser, client-side
- use svelte to wrap the UI
- add subdivision feature
    1. simple angle and length subdividing, like I experimented with on the original realisr
    2. iterative subdividing, preserving the measure transition points
    3. bezier curves
- add an editor where you can just draw the time plot and input some audio
